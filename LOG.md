- 001 ok/0 O(n) debug for 1 sec
- 002 ok/0 O(m+n) debug for 3 sec
- 003 ok/0 O(n) debug for 1 sec
- 004 ok/0 O(m+n) no debug / just spend a bit time
- 005 ok/1 O(n^2) debug for dp init problem, 30 sec
- 006 ok/1 O(n) failed for first 10min, but sloved after lunch break.
- 007 ok/0 O(n) no deubg.
  there's always something distract you in modern society :), but after a short break I m back.
- 008 Todo
- 009 ok/0 O(n) debug for 30 sec, problem is using n\*10 replace pow(10, n)
- 010 Todo its a hard dp RE match problem~
- 011 Failed, I spend 2 hours in a mono stack solution,   ok/1 (when just use a general two pointers method), What I want to say is mono stack just not suitable for this problem... ps: no debug
- 012 Todo-delay boring int and roman translate...
- 013 Todo-delay boring
- 014 ok/0 O(nk) no debug
- 015 ok/1 Spend some time to remove dulplicate result.
- 016 ok/0 debug for 10 min, the problem is misunderstood of the problem, need to return sum, not the closet divide result.
- 017 ok/0 I dont know why, but I just spend 5min and feel a mess , but it just pass the test... no debug
- 018 ok/1 debug for more than 10 min, the problem is dulplicate element produced by hash getSum.
- 019 ok/0 no debug
- 020 ok/0 debug for 2min, lost a else condition for push el to stack
- 021 ok/0 no debug, just a simple two way merge algorithm
- 022 Todo handle something... do it later because of the interuption
- 023 ok/0 debug for 5min, problem is I forget a ptr = ptr.Next
- 024 ok/0 debug for 10s, problem is I forget a ptr = head to init a pointer
- 025 failed/1 I can image how can I handle reverse a linked-list in O (1) space, just change the direction of the arrow, but the reality is I got confused in serverals minutes...
- 026 ok/1 remove dulplicate partition.
- 029 ok/0 debug for 10 sec, if x^y <0, x and y have different symbols

- 035 ok/0 debug for 10 sec, ignore border case
- 038 no/ignored ignored because it\'s a stupid comprehesive problem
- 039 ok/0 debug for 30 sec, manually write a dfs without struct for the first time...
- 040 ok/0 debug for 2 hours... problem is slice shallow copy...
- 041 ok/0 no debug
- 042 todo
- 043 no/ignored boring problem, why I need to impl a string product, do I need to build the computer from Iron and plastic? Everyone know we can use a*b in a program language. Now we have to realize a stupid one.
- 045 debug for 30 sec, nums => dp....
- 048 ok/0 debug for a bit time, confused in index, experience is using a arrow, and draw it down in the paper will be better.
- 049 ok/0 no debug.
- 050 no/ignored now. realize a pow...
- 051
- 054 no/2 spiral-order print matrix ...  in a mess when cantrol the index, it could be a rectangle. WTF :(, handle after 2 days for another try... ok/2.
- 055 ok/0 super easy, no debug
- 056 ok/0 no debug
- 057 ok/0 spend so much time debug and finish, and I haven\'t realize my binary search logn algorithm. now CT is O(logn+k)...
- 060 ok/1 care about details...
- 061 ok/0  rember that golang is value deliver, it means you cant modify a input *ListNode address, of course yuo can modify the content of the node...
- 058 ok/0 no debug
- 062 ok/0 no debug
- 063 ok/0 no debug
- 064 ok/0 no debug
- 065 no/ignored parse a number according to rules
- 066 ok/0 no debug
- 067 ok/0 debug for 10 sec
- 069 ok/0 debug for 30 sec, deserve redo.
- 070 ok/0 no debug. dont do it again, waste time, sososososossoso easy...
- 071 ok/0 debug for 10 sec
- 073 ok/1 no debug, But i dont catch up the idea to handle in 10 min.
- 074 ok/0 without any obstacles...
- 075 ok/0 no debug, blooooody easy
- 076 ok/0 debug for 3sec
- 077 ok/0 no debug, dont do it again, sheer waste of time
- 078 ok/0 no debug, dont do it again
- 079 ok/1 no debug
- 080 ok/1 30 min to debug... but not difficult, just distracted.
- 081 ok/0 no debug, but maybe I get a wrong solution due to the time-complexity hint.
- 082 ok/0 debug for 10 sec
- 083 ok/0 no debug
- 084 ok/1 debug for 5 min
- 085 ok/1 debug for 30 min, main in ignore the border case height[i] == height[i-1]
- 086 ok/0 no debug, but I can do it again, really easy but interesting problem if you haven\'t try linked list problem for a bit time
- 088 ok/0 debug for 30 sec. no finish job before
- 089 ok/ignored gray code is a concept problem, not about algorithm, just relative to understand of a new concept...
- 090 ok/0 hia hia hia, waste time but really happy, just feels like chased by killer in DBD :))), I\'m an insane input machine.
