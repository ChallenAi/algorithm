- 003 ok/0 O(n) debug for 1 sec
- 004 ok/0 O(m+n) no debug / just spend a bit time
- 005 ok/1 O(n^2) debug for dp init problem, 30 sec
- 006 ok/1 O(n) failed for first 10min, but sloved after lunch break.
- 007 ok/0 O(n) no deubg.
  there's always something distract you in modern society :), but after a short break I m back.
- 008 Todo
- 009 ok/0 O(n) debug for 30 sec, problem is using n\*10 replace pow(10, n)
- 010 Todo its a hard dp RE match problem~
- 011 Failed, I spend 2 hours in a mono stack solution
- 012 Todo-delay boring int and roman translate...
- 013 Todo-delay boring
- 014 ok/0 O(nk) no debug
- 015 ok/1 Spend some time to remove dulplicate result.
- 016 ok/0 debug for 10 min, the problem is misunderstood of the problem, need to return sum, not the closet divide result.
- 017 ok/0 I dont know why, but I just spend 5min and feel a mess , but it just pass the test... no debug
- 018 ok/1 debug for more than 10 min, the problem is dulplicate element produced by hash getSum.
- 019 ok/0 no debug
- 020 ok/0 debug for 2min, lost a else condition for push el to stack
- 021 ok/0 no debug, just a simple two way merge algorithm
- 022 Todo handle something... do it later because of the interuption
- 023 ok/0 debug for 5min, problem is I forget a ptr = ptr.Next
- 024 ok/0 debug for 10s, problem is I forget a ptr = head to init a pointer
- 025 failed/1 I can image how can I handle reverse a linked-list in O (1) space, just change the direction of the arrow, but the reality is I got confused in serverals minutes...
- 026 ok/1 remove dulplicate partition.
- 029 ok/0 debug for 10 sec, if x^y <0, x and y have different symbols

- 035 ok/0 debug for 10 sec, ignore border case
- 038 no/ignored ignored because it\'s a stupid comprehesive problem

- 045 debug for 30 sec, nums => dp....
- 048 ok/0 debug for a bit time, confused in index, experience is using a arrow, and draw it down in the paper will be better.
- 049 ok/0 no debug.
- 050 no/ignored now. realize a pow...
- 051
- 054 no/2 spiral-order print matrix ...  in a mess when cantrol the index, it could be a rectangle. WTF :(
