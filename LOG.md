- 010 ok/2 its a hard dp RE match problem~ 9.29.2020 debug for 2min for not considering a*b match "b", strongly recommend practice more, really interesting.
- 011 Failed, I spend 2 hours in a mono stack solution,   ok/1 (when just use a general two pointers method), What I want to say is mono stack just not suitable for this problem... ps: no debug
- 012 Todo-delay boring int and roman translate...

- 014 ok/0 O(nk) no debug
- 015 ok/1 Spend some time to remove dulplicate result.
- 016 ok/0 debug for 10 min, the problem is misunderstood of the problem, need to return sum, not the closet divide result.
- 017 ok/0 I dont know why, but I just spend 5min and feel a mess , but it just pass the test... no debug
- 018 ok/1 debug for more than 10 min, the problem is dulplicate element produced by hash getSum.
- 019 ok/0 no debug

- 021 ok/0 no debug, just a simple two way merge algorithm
- 022 Todo handle something... do it later because of the interuption
- 023 ok/0 debug for 5min, problem is I forget a ptr = ptr.Next
- 024 ok/0 debug for 10s, problem is I forget a ptr = head to init a pointer
- 025 failed/1 I can image how can I handle reverse a linked-list in O (1) space, just change the direction of the arrow, but the reality is I got confused in serverals minutes...
- 026 ok/1 remove dulplicate partition.
- 027 ok/0
- 028 Todo strStr

- 040 ok/0 debug for 2 hours... problem is slice shallow copy...
- 041 ok/0 no debug
- 042 todo
- 043 no/ignored boring problem, why I need to impl a string product, do I need to build the computer from Iron and plastic? Everyone know we can use a*b in a program language. Now we have to realize a stupid one.

- 055 ok/0 super easy, no debug
- 056 ok/0 no debug
- 057 ok/3 spend so much time debug and finish, and I haven\'t realize my binary search logn algorithm. now CT is O(logn+k)... A super difficult problem for my first and second try.

- 086 ok/0 no debug, but I can do it again, really easy but interesting problem if you haven\'t try linked list problem for a bit time
- 087 Todo
- 088 ok/0 debug for 30 sec. no finish job before
- 089 ok/ignored gray code is a concept problem, not about algorithm, just relative to understand of a new concept...
- 090 ok/0 hia hia hia, waste time but really happy, just feels like chased by killer in DBD :))), I\'m an insane input machine.
